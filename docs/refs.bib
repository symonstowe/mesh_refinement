	doi = {10.1109/EMBC.2013.6611026},
	abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography ({EIT}) reconstructs images of electrical tissue properties within a body from electrical transfer impedance measurements at surface electrodes. Reconstruction of {EIT} images requires the solution of an inverse problem in soft field tomography, where a sensitivity matrix, J, of the relationship between internal changes and measurements is calculated, and then a pseudo-inverse of J is used to update the image estimate. It is therefore clear that a precise calculation of J is required for solution accuracy. Since it is generally not possible to use analytic solutions, the finite element method ({FEM}) is typically used. It has generally been recommended in the {EIT} literature that {FEMs} be refined near electrodes, since the electric field and sensitivity is largest there. In this paper we analyze the accuracy requirement for {FEM} refinement near electrodes in {EIT} and describe a technique to refine arbitrary {FEMs}.},

	abstract = {{EIDORS} is an open source software suite for image reconstruction in electrical impedance tomography and diffuse optical tomography, designed to facilitate collaboration, testing and new research in these fields. This paper describes recent work to redesign the software structure in order to simplify its use and provide a uniform interface, permitting easier modification and customization. We describe the key features of this software, followed by examples of its use. One general issue with inverse problem software is the difficulty of correctly implementing algorithms and the consequent ease with which subtle numerical bugs can be inadvertently introduced. {EIDORS} helps with this issue, by allowing sharing and reuse of well-documented and debugged software. On the other hand, since {EIDORS} is designed to facilitate use by non-specialists, its use may inadvertently result in such numerical errors. In order to address this issue, we develop a list of ways in which such errors with inverse problems (which we refer to as ‘cheats’) may occur. Our hope is that such an overview may assist authors of software to avoid such implementation issues.},

	abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) uses electrical stimulation and measurement at the body surface to image the electrical properties of internal tissues. It has the advantage of noninvasiveness and high temporal resolution but suffers from poor spatial resolution and sensitivity to electrode movement and contact quality. {EIT} can be useful to applications, where there are conductive contrasts between tissues, fluids, or gasses, such as imaging of cancerous or ischemic tissue or functional monitoring of breathing, blood flow, gastric motility, and neural activity. The past decade has seen clinical application and commercial activity using {EIT} for ventilation monitoring. Interpretation of {EIT}-based measures is complex, and this review paper focuses on describing the image interpretation “pathway.” We review this pathway, from Tissue Electrical Properties, {EIT} Electrodes \& Hardware, Sensitivity, Image Reconstruction, Image Processing to {EIT} Measures. The relationship is discussed between the clinically relevant parameters and the reconstructed properties. An overview is given of areas of {EIT} application and of our perspectives for research and development.},

	abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) is a low-cost, noninvasive and radiation free medical imaging modality for monitoring ventilation distribution in the lung. Although such information could be invaluable in preventing ventilator-induced lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients, clinical application of {EIT} is hindered by difficulties in interpreting the resulting images. One source of this difficulty is the frequent use of simple shapes which do not correspond to the anatomy to reconstruct {EIT} images. The mismatch between the true body shape and the one used for reconstruction is known to introduce errors, which to date have not been properly characterized. In the present study we, therefore, seek to 1) characterize and quantify the errors resulting from a reconstruction shape mismatch for a number of popular {EIT} reconstruction algorithms and 2) develop recommendations on the tolerated amount of mismatch for each algorithm. Using real and simulated data, we analyze the performance of four {EIT} reconstruction algorithms under different degrees of shape mismatch. Results suggest that while slight shape mismatch is well tolerated by all algorithms, using a circular shape severely degrades their performance.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the numerical treatment applied to the singular values of the sensitivity matrix in the presence of noisy measurements, subsequently suggesting electrode configurations that provide sensitivities with improved characteristics. We begin by examining the impact of the individual singular values on the spatial resolution of the image and then proceed to express the generalized Tikhonov regularization in terms of the generalized singular value decomposition in order to demonstrate how the reconstructed image is synthesized from the individual energy components. The electrode segmentation scheme is then introduced as a feasible configuration offering efficient and improved resolution impedance imaging. Finally, the regularized total least squares algorithm is implemented to provide the linear step solution within Newton’s iterative scheme. Images of several reconstructed inhomogeneities are presented, using simulated measurements obtained from the segmented electrodes system.},
